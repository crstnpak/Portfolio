             I bought these jeans in Brooklyn during some Saturday afternoon in March 2019. The brand
             is Levis and I purchased them from an Opening Ceremony sample sale. When I tried them on, 
             I asked a stranger if I should get them and they said no because they were too long on me. 
             I did not take this advice and bought them anyways since they made my butt look good. I 
             have worn them religiously for two years.
